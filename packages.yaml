    summary: >-
        NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and flexible monitoring daemon.
        It was built for Nagios/Icinga/Naemon, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga
        specific and it can and is used in many other scenarios where you want to
        receive/distribute check metrics
